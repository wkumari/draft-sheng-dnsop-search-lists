    <abstract>
      <t>A Domain Name System (DNS) "search list" (hereafter, simply "search
      list") is conceptually implemented as an ordered list of domain names.
      When the user enters a name, the domain names in the search list are
      used as suffixes to the user-supplied name, one by one, until either a
      name is successfully resolved or the search list is exhausted.</t>

      <t>Processing search lists was weakly standardized in early Requests For
      Comments (RFCs) and implemented in most operating systems. However, as
      the Internet has grown, search list behavior has diversified.
      Applications (e.g., web browsers and mail clients) and DNS resolvers
      process search lists differently. In addition, some of these behaviors
      present security and privacy issues to end systems, can lead to
      performance problems for the Internet, and might cause collision with
      names provisioned under the newly delegated top-level domains.</t>

      <t>In this document, we suggested several options to deprecate the use
      of search lists.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Many organizations create subdomains under their primary domain(s) to
      delegate or distribute management of the namespace, reduce the load on
      the authoritative DNS servers, and more easily distinguish a host's
      organizational and/or geographical affiliations.</t>

      <t>As a convenience to users, many operating systems implement search
      list processing, a feature that allows a user to enter a partial name in
      an application, with the operating system expanding the name through
      entries in a search list. For example, if a user has a search list of
      "corp.example.com;berlin.example.com;example.com" and she types "system"
      into her browser's address box, the operating system would try
      "system.corp.example.com", "system.berlin.example.com",
      "system.example.com", and perhaps "system." in some order.</t>

      <t>Search list processing, including order of operations for search list
      processing, was loosely specified in <xref
      target="RFC1123"/>(specifically, section 6.1.4.3 (2)), <xref
      target="RFC1535"/>, and <xref target="RFC1536"/> and has been
      implemented in most operating systems. However, as the Internet has
      grown, search list behavior has diversified. Applications (e.g., web
      browser and mail clients) and DNS resolvers process search list suffixes
      differently. Some of these behaviors also present security and privacy
      issues to end systems, and performance problems both for the end system
      and the Internet.</t>

      <t>In this document, we suggested several options to deprecate the use
      of search lists.</t>

      <section title="Requirements notation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Proposal">
      <t>No automatically generated search lists. [TODO: What is an
      automatically generated search list?] Administrators (including DHCP
      server administrators) should configure the search list explicitly, and
      must not use implicit search lists (as defined in Section 2). Where DNS
      parameters such as the domain search list have been manually configured,
      these parameters should not be overridden by DHCP. These are suggested
      default processing rules. Operating system / resolve vendors may provide
      configuration options to override these.</t>

      <t>Unqualified Single-Label Domain Names Are Never Queried Directly.
      When a user enters a single label name, that name may be subject to
      search list processing if a search list is specified, but must never be
      queried in the DNS in its original single-label form.</t>

      <t>Unqualified Multi-label Domain Names Never Use Search Lists. When a
      user queries a hostname that contain two or more labels separated by
      dots, such as www.server, applications and resolvers must query the DNS
      directly. Search lists must not be applied even if such names do not
      resolve.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Negative Consequences For the Change">
      <t>There are administrators that today rely on both automatic generation
      of search lists, and the automatic propagation of search lists to
      clients via DHCP. The proposed change would require reconfiguration of
      systems.</t>

      <t>There are users, and links in web pages, that use partially qualified
      names (such as www.corp) instead of either just a single token or a
      fully qualified domain name.</t>

      <t>Changing search list behavior of unqualified multi-label domain names
      would reduce the utility of these names.</t>

      <t>Finally, not all applications currently in use treat these categories
      of domain names in the same way. Incompatibilities and operational
      problems, specifically in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environments,
      already exist.</t>
